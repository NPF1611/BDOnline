                                    History ="Wizards, or Sages, as they prefer to call themselves, appeared on this land not too long ago. Contemporary scholars, however, argue that the traces of Sages can be dated far back to the ancient times. In a world far away from this world, there was a circle of knowledge seekers specializing in supernatural phenomena. Knowledge was their light, calling, and treasure. Seeking knowledge and truth became quite literally the most noble cause of their lives. The community was divided into several schools throughout the history. The Godr-Ayed Tier, specializing in ancient elements, was the most powerful and respected school of Sages. There was also a particular school of thought focused on the earth and lightning elements. It was called Labreve, and it only consisted of Witches, female Sages. Although Labreve was a young organization, its growth was being expedited by a gifted Witch named Deneve. Unlike other schools of thought, they were specifically focused on studying Aad’s Pharos to research the ancient energy of elements, and their purely theoretical approach greatly contributed to the reconstruction of the existing magical powers. One of Deneve’s most prized achievements is the invention of the teleport technique by approaching Aad’s Pharos from a completely new perspective. The teleport technique was received well and highly acclaimed within the Sage community that it became a prerequisite skill for all the Sages to learn. Even after successfully executing the teleport skill for the first time, Deneve never stopped her research. Unlike other Sages, she believed that an unknown world existed outside the existence of the very world she lived in. This firm belief motivated Deneve to concentrate even more on Aad’s Pharos. Deneve’s dedication finally came to fruition. She finally discovered a method to commune with the primal force of the two elements. Through the newly-discovered method, Deneve could summon the Keepers Gorr and Tett and reach the enlightenment by communing with them. Deneve created a Sphera, an artifact through which she could freely utilize the new method. She carried the Spheras with her anytime, anywhere, completely breathing through and living with the purity of the two elements. The newly invented artifact was named Aad Sphera, after the subject she specialized in. It was through communing with the Aad Sphera that convinced Deneve to acknowledge the existence of another world. It was a dangerous move, but Deneve risked herself and everything she had to attempt to teleport to the other world. After a series of glaring lights and bombastic noises, Deneve found herself on a foreign land where day and night existed. She was the first Sage to make it to the other world. Thrilled to experience the new world and fresh energy, Deneve went out of her way to absorb all the knowledge she could. From one new land to another, her journey continued.From this journey, Deneve had learned that the world consists of everything the Sages had been studying, and also that she was not the first to travel inter-dimensionally. Someone went ahead of her, and Deneve wanted to identify the pioneer. Just as Deneve was trying to teleport to another world in search of the traces of the pioneer, she felt a tremendous force trying to dismantle the boundary between dimensions. As soon as the boundary was destroyed, Deneve started dreaming of herself being engulfed by a colossal black lump. She was unable to process a single thought when she woke up. The only thing she could barely feel was that the land she was stepping on felt somehow familiar.",

                                    History ="The world of Sages, the world far and foreign. Godr-Ayed Tier was the leading organization of the Sages in the distant world. Founded by three young wizards, Godr-Ayed Tier sought pure knowledge of ancient elements.A particular Wizard among the three, codename Lord Red, was the wisest of all, within and outside the Godr-Ayed Tier. He was always a step ahead, and all researches conducted within Godr-Ayed Tier could not come to fruition without him. Lord Red was proud of his position, and always strived for perfection. One of Lord Red’s most acclaimed achievements is the invention of “Sphera”, the first magic gear. Lord Red named this first gear Godr Sphera, after Godr-Ayed Tier.After the invention of the Sphera, his studies saw a giant leap. He was able to summon and commune with two puppets using Godr Sphera, namely Marg, the guardian of Fire, and Arne, the guardian of Water. Marg had a destructive potential and Arne provided a spiritual support. The achievement was both blessing and curse, especially because of Marg, the guardian of Fire. Its destructive nature was sometimes difficult to take under control. Only Lord Red could manage to control it using the Godr Sphera.The situation concerned the entire Godr-Ayed Tier. Their purpose was to enrich the knowledge through elemental forces, not destruction. This caused a schism within the group. A group that had been bitter toward Lord Red started questioning the stability of his method. After a consensus was reached, the entire Godr-Ayed Tier started denouncing Lord Red as a madman blinded by the pursuit of destruction.Lord Red was certainly aware of the change of reception, but he was too immersed in his studies to react. The Godr-Ayed Tier drifted farther and farther away from him, and people even started giving credits to Marg instead of Lord Red. Soon enough, someone else was being admired as the greatest wizard of all time. Lord Red’s huge ego did not allow himself to keep cool. He threatened the Godr-Ayed Tier several times using his almighty fire magic, but to no avail.Eventually he tried to take over the Godr-Ayed Tier using the fire magic that even Lord Red himself could not control. It was when Lord Red was attacking the Wizard’s Chamber, the center of the world, when Godr-Ayed Tier’s own consumption magic was activated. In the end, Lord Red was confined in a distorted space for defying the nature’s law.Marg’s destructive power could not be stopped nevertheless, constantly consuming Lord Red’s body and soul. While suffering, Lord Red realized that the elemental force had completely consumed him, and started fighting back at Marg. He managed to suppress Marg, but Lord Red aged significantly afterward.A significant amount of time had passed. When he was about to lose all his sensibilities as a human being, he could suddenly feel another human being trying to approach the distorted space he was trapped in. It was a Witch who used to live in the same world as he did, and she was focused on studying a totally different kind of “Sphera”. Lord Red realized that she was following his traces, and saw his past self in her pure passion for knowledge. He felt agitated when the Witch was getting close. For the first time in his life, he “feared” that the pure Witch might be trapped and consumed by the force if she entered where he was.In order to reconstruct his soul, and to save the Witch, Lord Red ended up destroying the Godr Sphera, dissolved the boundary in the pillar of space-travel, and eventually was swept away in a gigantic explosion. He woke up and opened his eyes, and he could finally feel human emotions forming inside him when he looked at his own reflection in the lake. He felt as though the lake saved his life.",

                                    History ="A group of big men that appear chiseled from granite are riding horses through a vast, barren land where the wind settles after travelling through a long valley. The most impressive of the bunch shouts at the top of his lungs,( Run, Ichi, Run!) Ichi, lazing on a rock, is suddenly startled and falls to the ground.It is just another day for Ichi and her father, the chief of the Oeki Clan in Ryuta is southeastern region. Her father is always keen on correcting his daughter is slothful ways. The Ryuta region mostly consists of barren lands, and people usually survive off hunting and gathering while leading communal lives. For the Oeki Clan, (Protect yourself) is the chief motto.The Oeki usually use light weapons such as Shortswords and kunai, but their level of training has been elevated as a result of the recent territorial conflict with the Sonan Clan from across the Turina River. The Oeki chief had always tried to maintain a friendly relationship with them, but to no avail. This will soon be a grave concern for Ichi, too, since she is supposed to inherit the chiefdom. She is smart, talented in many ways, and compassionate, just like a chief is daughter should be.Drought came to the Ryuta region one scorching summer. Just as everyone was about to collapse in exhaustion from the drought, Ichi felt a drop of water hit her nose. It was just a drop, but rain to be sure. Excited, Ichi mounted her horse and galloped to the Turina River in no time.When she stopped by the riverbank to rest, she discovered a woman who had fainted on the other side of the river. Ichi put the woman on her horse and ran to the town. The woman was on the verge of unconsciousness, but the Oeki Clan is care and treatment worked wonders. After waking up, the woman confessed that she was from the Sonan Clan, which embarrassed and upset everyone around her, including the chief. Ichi begged and begged her father to accept her, and the Oeki Clan finally decided to take the Sonan woman in.After fully recovering, the Sonan woman woke Ichi up one night, saying she wanted to show Ichi something. What she brought with her was a traditional Sonan weapon. It was shaped like a gigantic ring big enough to cover one is entire body, and was sharply bladed on one side. The weapon is name was Sah Chakram. Ichi told the Sonan woman that the Sah Chakram reminded her of the gleaming moon, which caused the woman great joy.The woman explained that the circular shape of the Sah Chakram symbolized acceptance of all things and that for everything the beginning and the ending are the same. Of course, Ichi was too young to comprehend all that, but there was something about it that made her deeply compelled to learn the art of the Sah Chakram.Tragedy struck when Ichi just got used to handling the Sah Chakram. The Sonan Clan found the refugee woman, and she knew she had nowhere else to run. After agonizing long and hard, the woman sent a message to her own clan, stating that she was willing to help them infiltrate and destroy the Oeki Clan at once, as long as she would be set free afterward.While Ichi was asleep, the village burned. Chaos reigned as people ran through the camp in a panic and the sounds of weapons clashed in the night. After awakening, Ichi too was forced to fight with nothing more than a Shortsword she picked up from the ground. No one was able to fight with their full might because the Sonan woman had poured a mysterious substance in the well. The enormous power of the Sah Chakram would also be the Oek is undoing.The Sonans had been unable to conquer the Oeki before because they were always outnumbered. But this time was different. The Oeki clan was eradicated, save for a few prisoners of war. After managing to flee into the forest, Ichi shed bloodstained tears. After days of crying she sat up, eyes as wide as the full moon. At that moment she swore she would survive the ordeal. She then returned to her village, only to witness a terrible scene. Amidst a pile of dead bodies, she managed to find a Sah Chakram the Sonans had left behind. She felt a mixture of profound sadness and rage.Ichi searched for the traitor, but it seemed the Sonan woman had already fled the Ryuta region. Ichi softly uttered a vow to her dead father at the foot of his grave: With this Sah Chakram, I will make them pay for what they have done. I wont rest until the moon turns pale and all else is covered in the Crimson of blood.",

                                    History ="There once was a poor boy who lived in the forest of a small fiefdom in a far eastern realm. A well-to-do girl occasionally came to the same forest for walks and against all odds this ragtag little boy and this silk-wearing girl soon became best friends. They eventually grew up and developed romantic feelings for one another. But this wealthy girl could never marry a boy of such poor stock.The girl was the eldest daughter of the House of Narusawa, the ruling family of the fiefdom. Her future groom, the son of another lord, had already been arranged and she was destined to take over as head of her house. The boy had no concern for any of this, however, and decided to leave the forest to learn the art of combat so he could protect the girl one day. Whether fate, so cruel in denying the two lovers, was moved by the boys devotion was unclear. What is known is that on his journey the boy experienced a great stroke of luck in his encounter with a retired army general known as Sura, who was famous for sweeping through battlefields wielding six swords at once.The boy trained under his guidance for years, and eventually returned to the girls side as a powerful warrior. Soon after the girl was appointed as the head of her house, a civil war broke out in the kingdom as several lords rose up to defy the oppressive and exploitative central government. In the midst of this turmoil, the boy did everything he could to protect the girl. The sight of this boy covered in the blood of his enemies as he merciless slashed away with his six swords caused opponents to cower, convinced that the legendary Sura had returned to the battlefield. Stability returned to the kingdom after much bloodshed, and soon an era of great peace reigned. Everyone appeared happy on the outside, but the trials were only beginning for the boy and girl.A fierce war eventually erupted between the former revolutionaries as each sought to establish themselves as the master of the realm. The Narusawa house and the girl, now a young woman, were being watched by these ambitious power seekers. The young woman yielded the honor of her house and gave up as much wealth as she could simply to survive, but the harsh reality of the times would not leave her be. Word on the street was that the she could soon be framed for treason.The boy, now a grown young man himself, felt the need to protect the young woman and the House of Narusawa from the new powers of the realm. However, there was not much a wandering swordsman and his gang of followers could do. He first needed to figure out how to make a living.The young man persuaded the young woman to change the family name of her house and they moved back to the forest where they spent their childhood together. The young man and his gang started a little business for collecting and selling important pieces of information. The young woman took charge of classifying and managing this information and eventually they were able to make a living. Of course, there was a period of trial and error; the espionage scene was different from the battlefield.The group eventually gave up the long swords that hindered their mobility for more agile Shortswords. They revised their martial arts style to make it suitable for infiltration and assassination operations. They hid their identities, patiently waited, and trained endlessly. They called themselves “Ninjas.”The family was on its way back to stability, but tragedy struck from the most unexpected source. One of their colleagues who just returned from a mission to the West seemed to have caught a cold, but that illness turned his eyes red and made him go berserk. He soon began attacking everyone around him. The madman was taken care of, but the disease was already spreading, poisoning the bodies and minds of the entire house.Even the young were infected by the disease. One day the young woman, who had been taking care of the infected day and night, began to show symptoms. The young man had no problem slaying the others once they became infected, but he could never do the same for the young woman. He searched the entire kingdom to find a doctor who could help, but the best anyone could do was put her into a coma using acupuncture so that she might one day be cured. It seemed the worst had passed for the time being, but the young mans trials were only beginning.The young man never lost hope, but he knew he needed to find the source of the terrible disease if they were to ever find a cure. He decided to head to the West, which he determined to be the source of the disease, intending to eventually return to his homeland to rebuild the crippled house.The young man visited the young woman on the day he would set forth. The maids taking care of her left the room so they could be alone for the first time since childhood.However, the young woman did not awaken.Before he left, the young man made a vow to the young woman:On the day when Sura returns, the Narusawa flag shall fly again on the field of battle.",

An army officer noticed her talent in fighting, and adopted her.Through a rigorous training and education in the new home, the girl grew up to be an elegant young lady as if she had been born to that family from the beginning. The time came for her to work for the family, but she was ineligible for taking the public hiring examination in spite of her intellect, since she was a child of a concubine. The only option left for her was to join the Order of the Apricot and become one of their warriors. The girl started training in the order a year after she decided to join it.The girl never flinched in the order where it was full of great warriors from all walks of life. A year later, the girl graduated from the apprenticeship, and another year later, she became eligible for being elected as the Maehwa, the leader of the female warriors. While she was elated by her own success, an old woman visited.Three years have passed since the girl joined the Order of the Apricot, and the continent was once again swept by the craze of war. The war was an opportunity for the warriors in the order to develop their career, and the girl, needless to say, took part in the war and gradually made her name as the next leader of the order.A month after the end of the war, the girl finally became the leader of the order. She was the youngest and the first female leader in the order's history. As soon as the ceremony was concluded, she went into the deepest cave in the valley to check the secret of the order. She became who she was just to see this secret. An old spear and a secret note were located in the cave. After verifying the old woman's story as true, the joyous girl wasted no time to start learning the secrets.After a year of training, there was still no sign of flame on the girl's spear. Nothing seemed to be improving compared to her old blade techniques. However, as it was her only dream, she did not give up and kept training. The news of her step-parents' passing found a way to her the next year, but she did not care, only focusing on the secret of the Crescent Petal. Her martial arts were simply not advancing at all, and that was about when she started having nightmares. She had to confront the sacrificed colleagues, subordinates, innocent civilians, and the contenders every night.It had been five years since the discovery of secret note. Countless hours of training had her no closer to acquiring the Crescent Petal. She decided go back to the cave she found the secret note in. The old woman who told the story of the Crescent Petal was waiting for the her.As soon as she spotted the young woman, the old woman charged at her with a spear. Startled, the young woman parried with her own spear. As the tips of both spears touched, a blue flame emerged from the old woman's spear. It was the Crescent Petal.They sparred until dawn, when it was clear that the young woman lost. She was so exhausted that she couldn’t even move a finger, but she somehow felt satisfied. She finally felt like she was beginning to understand what Bihwasun meant. The girl resigned from her leadership position the next day and left the valley. She traveled lightly, because all she needed was the teachings of Bihwasun in her heart: Never be afraid to start over again.The day your shell breaks, the Crescent Petal will answer your call.",

The villagers took it as a good sign, expecting that the boy would become the pride of the town.The villagers transferred their high expectation for this boy’s supposedly dead father to him. The boy grew up with a gift in martial arts. He remained undefeated throughout his entire youth, and that made him highly arrogant but lonely.He dreamed of joining the Western Frontiers, an elite group of martial artists composed solely of the winners of the kingdom's decennial Grand Tournament Ares. The villagers and the young man had no doubts that he would be triumphant.The next Grand Tournament Ares finally arrived. To no surprise, the young man made it to the final round. However, the focus was on an old martial arts master who nonchalantly defeated every other master in the continent with his gigantic scimitar.Final round. The entire continent was watching the young man and the old master's duel. Amidst the bloody battle without room for even a single mistake, the young man strangely started to think that this old master was, in fact, somehow very much like himself.After a heated offensive and defensive battle, the young man instinctively felt his defeat. The first humiliation in his entire life. He threw a desperate last blow without much expectation, and some kind of odd miracle happened. The old master started vomiting blood and the young man did not miss that weak moment. The young man claimed the new title of the Martial God after winning the Grand Tournament Ares, and finally joined the Western Union. He just achieved his childhood dream, but he did not feel achieved. He rather felt enraged. The cheers and laud of the audience should have been solely for him, but they all went to the old master who tried his best till the end.The humiliation did not end there. The Western Union, his dream league, was, of course, full of monsters, and that league was dictated by pure merit, not seniority, so the young man was put at the bottom of the hierarchy. For someone like him who believed there was no one above him, it was unbearable.Blaming everything on the old master, the young man set out to search for him. The old man was living in a cave deep in a mountain. He had withered so much that it was hard to believe he was the same old man who fought the young man in the tournament. The young man challenged the old master again regardless. Yet another bloody duel, but the young man lost again. The young man did not give in, and repeatedly challenged the old master as soon as he finished recovering. Each time the young man was defeated the old master dropped several drops of the Clear Water inside his mouth and consoled him.The young man managed to defeat the old master. The victorious young man expressed his admiration of the old master and begged to be the master's apprentice. The old man gladly accepted.For a short while, the young man was happy for the first time in a long time. However, the old man’s health suddenly deteriorated and he died. The death hit the young man hard. While preparing for the funeral he spotted the Martial God Secrets next to the teacher's will.The old master was actually the legendary Martial God Haeam. Haeam was supposedly assassinated in the midst of a power struggle after he had climbed to the top of the Western Frontiers group. He was also the young man’s presumably dead, absentee father. Upon recalling the old master's warmth towards him, the young man could not stop the flow of tears running down his face.The young man confronted the Western Frontiers to defeat his father's old nemeses. He also claimed the Crescent Blade, the symbolic weapon of the leader of the Western Frontiers. He left the Crescent Blade on his father’s grave and boarded a ship bound to the West with the Martial God's Secrets.",

The key difference between the two involves Bladers being more AoE centric in their play style, as a few of their skills allow for a broader scope of damage.This gives them a little more utility in group fights in regards to PvP, and makes their life a bit easier in PvE grinding. They still run very light armor and rely heavily on mobility to sustain them in fights, making sieges and larger fights tricky for novice players.New players are advised to keep in mind there is a bit of a learning curve involved with any low armor class in Black Desert, as they are less forgiving of mistakes.

When the ship had finally reached unknown destination, three of us had become just one.The land filled with black hair as dark as their eyes. I was nothing but an outsider. For a weak boy picking through the garbage in the street markets, running into my quirky master was sheer luck.With him I wandered all over the continent and learned to be literate along with everything else. When my heart seems to have settled in this once-unfamiliar land, I decided to enter the Grand Tournament, the only shot for an outsider and a brawler like myself to earn a fair title.I took the champion title. The Grand Tournament had granted me the chance to join the Western Frontiers, the guild of finest martial artists without segregation of any kind.I was somewhat ready. But for a vagabond who had not followed any rules and boundaries before, the communal life of strict principles felt like prison bars. My background as a blue-eyed foreigner had already received enough attention and discrimination which put me in introspection.Impoverished and confused, I accepted my master’s suggestion to head West to discover my roots. The place of my birth. The place with those in the same hair color and pupils.

She stood out wherever she went, which was expected since she was carrying a Lancia and a shield, both as big as herself, so nonchalantly. The kind of unique techniques she performed required an extremely high level of Sacred Power, and the way she executed them could have never been more effortless.Astounded by Enslar's unique talent, the Elionian Church published A Treatise on Valkyrie, named after Enslar's nickname, Valkyries, and the church soon proceeded to establish the Holy College of Calpheon to completely focus on training Valkyries.The Holy College was under a direct provision of the Elionian Church, and its sole purpose was to train perfect Valkyries.Enslar was appointed as the commander of the Holy College, but there was few things she could do on her own. The Elionian Church suggested extremely meticulous procedures in recruiting girls, and they have no leniency in cutting off anyone who did not meet the standard, however trivial it may be. Enslar never agreed with the Church's way, but she had no say.After finally polishing themselves up decent enough through many ordeals, the Valkyrie squad received their first mission: to seal the unstable and half-summoned Kzarka which had appeared at the Calpheon Shrine. However, the secret message Enslar received the night before from Bacho Ladericcio said otherwise:All chaos shall exalt Elion. Present the Valkyries before Kzarka, and offer their pure blood as a sacrifice. When the elite Valkyries started fighting Kzarka at Calpheon Shrine, Enslar was agonizing inside. Eventually, Enslar disobeyed the Elionian Church, and with the help of other Valkyries, successfully defeated the manifestation of Kzarka at Calpheon Shrine.Enslar soon disappeared after leaving the following last words: Justice in your head, Elion in your heart, and the scale of ideology only on the tip of the Lancia.",

One of the key differences is the retention of a high amount of battlefield agility and general movement, allowing for skilled players to dodge in and out of fights at lightning speed.Only the fiercest and most battle honed veterans carry the title of Warrior. These men are adept in all forms of close quarter combat, clad in sturdy heavy armor, tactfully deflecting blows with sword and shield, yet remain nimble enough to dodge around the battlefield avoiding attackers as they strike deep into the enemy lines.They also belong to the exclusive group of classes that can block all frontal damage (to a point) while holding their block stance. This gives them a decent bit of forgiveness for mistakes, but ultimately requires some patience to learn when to drop their defenses and begin their strike. In solo PvP they handle themselves very well, and while not equipped with many support skills they still prove quite valuable in group PvP thanks to their survivability and zone control capacity.Players looking for a hardy tank class with high mobility and damage (when played well) are advised to go the path of the warrior. While challenging to perfect the class, it's fairly welcoming to new players.",

The evidence lies in the village of Tarif.Tarif was founded about 300 years ago by Cartian and Allan Serbin. The Book of Cartian, which is religiously read and worshipped in this town, is like the textbook for sorcerers, although not everything was written down in the Book. One of the things omitted from the book is the Scythe, the weapon of the great sorceress Cartian.In Cartian's time, there was a major territorial war between men and Cyclopes. When the Cyclopes were about to destroy humans with their physical superiority, it is said that Cartian single-handedly banished all the Cyclops with the scythe. That was when the sorcerers split into several groups and went their way. It is said that Cartian, who moved to Mediah and founded Tarif, had lived very long, considerably more so than an average human being.Shortly before the near-immortal Cartian disappeared, she sealed the entirety of her destructive power in her scythe.Since nobody could deal with the power of the scythe, Allan Serbin, Cartian's good friend and the chief of Tarif, sealed the scythe again under the sacred tree called Scuffling Letusa. Allan Serbin lost his body due to that incident, and he has been trapped in a portrait ever since, looking down at Tarif.Since, a new chapter was added to its dark history.The one who holds the Cartian's Scythe will gain immortality.",

A woman with a baby in her arms arrived at this island. However, she passed away not long after, leaving the baby to be discovered by a passing animal later. At first, it must have been pure curiosity about a creature it has never seen before. As the time goes, the animal grew fond of the baby's pure heart, and it was raising the baby with its own offsprings before it realized.The baby grew to became a little girl when Hwisa, after completing a long journey, returned to the island with his companion beast, Heilang. Hwisa tried to find a right successor on his journey, but he came back to the island to relax after failing to find one. The sight of a little girl living with animals got Hwisa deeply interested, and he eventually took her as his student. Having lived with animals all her life, the little girl never got afraid of Heilang's threatening appearance, and soom became friends with it. She started absorbing Hwisa's teachings like a sponge.As she grew to become more human than an animal, the girl started questioning her identity and origin, which nobody knew about. Only one clue existed, however; the woman who was carrying the girl as a baby arrived on the Haemo Island. The girl's curiosity led her to step into the outside human world behind her teacher's knowledge.It took the girl several years figuring out who she really is, and the result was not completely welcoming. She was standing right in the turmoil of a civil war. The entire royal family was slaughtered by rebels. One of the queen's handmaid managed to save a newborn princess and escape, and she reached the Haemo Island, a forbidden area, after running away from the chasers.Haemo Island was already swept in blood when the girl returned after learning about herself. It must have been because those in power had learned that the girl was alive and trying to learn about her past, traveling all over the country.The girl grieved the death of Hwisa, her teacher, and held a funeral for him all the while realizing that she could not live in this country anymore. Before leaving, the girl left the Celestial Bo Staff, her most prized possession, at Hwisa's grave. As she was about to get off the mountain foot, a fluffy dark shadow appeared in front of her. It was a baby of the late mother Heilang. It was still a frail baby, but the girl decided to take it with her on the journey, thinking it would still be better than being alone.She headed west with the baby Heilang. The journey to the West was not smooth. She had to confront the Black Energy she remembered from the turmoil of the civil war, which led to the death of her beloved family and teacher. After nearly dying several times, the girl recalled what Hwisa said to her when she was younger: The heaven-trembling power shall follow the true master of Heilang.",

                                    History ="In the beginning of time, before the time of recorded history, a sacred tree settled its root at the highest place of the forest. Goddess Sylvia came down with the spirits of nature, gave the name of Kamasylve to the tree, and conceived life from the energy of the sun and moon. The land beneath the tree was soon called Kamasylvia. The goddess bore twins. The child resembling the sun was named Ganelle, and the child resembling the moon was named Vedir.While nurturing her own children, the goddess one day ascended back to the sky after sealing her will to Kamasylve, the sacred tree. The children established a civilization and prosper under the protection of the spirits and the sacred tree. The power of Kamasylve was abundant. The descendants of Sylvia took advantage of it as much as they could. Indulged in abundance and cornucopia, they became lazier day after day. One day, the dark spirits who were after the power of the sacred tree ravaged Kamasylvia.The war was devastating. The lethargic children of Sylvia were unable to protect themselves, and the burden of defending the land fell solely on Kamasylve, at least until the goddess reappeared. Having consumed all its energy in defending the land of the goddess from the dark spirits, the tree went into a long hibernation, leaving some of its oldest branches to Ganelle and Vedir.After long studies, Ganelle and Vedir discovered that the branches could be turned into the Kamasylven Sword with the power of the spirits, and they learned the art of the Kamasylven Sword. Moreover, they collected and shared the remaining branches with their kinsmen and taught them the art of using the power. This is how the Rangers, a standing army of the guardians of Kamasylvia against invasions, was established.There were several more invasions seeking the dormant Sacred Tree's power afterward, and the Rangers kept improving their archery in order to establish an even more efficient way of defense. They also diligently studied and developed the art of the Kamasylven Sword.The argument between Ganelle and Vedir over how one should utilize the Kamasylven Sword arose around this time. Ganelle, a descendant of the sun, pursued the harmony and commune with the sword's spirit, whereas Vedir, a descendant of the moon, wishes to make the spirit succumb and have control over it.The dispute between the two led to a civil war within the Ranger group, which eventually caused Kamasylve the Sacred Tree to be awakened to witness the blood-swept land of the goddess. Expressing deep sorrow for the fierce conflict of its descendants over its power, the goddess-laden Kamasylve completely shut down all the power to its branches. Upon this incidents, the descendants of Ganelle stayed in Kamasylvia, protecting the temple erected upon the sacred tree, while the descendants of Vedir ventured out in search of the origin of a new power, causing a schism between the two clans.Kamasylve, the Sacred Tree, decided to share its mysterious power only to the chosen ones in order to prepare itself for future invasions, and also to prevent future violent conflicts within the clan. The chosen one to receive this special gift from the Mother Goddess shall have an excellent grasp of martial arts as well as strong physique and mentality. Before going back to a long hibernation, Kamasylve left the following message to its descendants: Only those who commune with the spirit and control themselves shall fully inherit the power of Kamasylve.",

As it was said above there is a special stunning skill which can control enemies, but it’s not the only way to do it. There is one more way to control opponents – use kicks. Kicks make enemies feel dizzy. This effect is like a stun but when you hit enemy once more the dizzy disappears. This may help you to increase distance if enemies come close.Not everyone will find Archers to fit their style of play due to the nature of kiting, but those who stick with it will find there is decent growth for expert level play.",

That gave him the nickname Kid Tantu, which, of course, he detested. His determination and aggressiveness were more than enough to lead the young Giants nevertheless, and he was also smart enough to inject ambitions into them. Moreover, his adventurousness led him to travel all over the continent to find a place for the tribe to live and prosper.One day at dawn, Tantu disappeared with his followers. According to rumors, he settled down somewhere in Mediah, in an ancient land where resplendant resonations prosper. Tantu conspired with the Dwarves living in the ancient land.Giants and Dwarves are like brothers. It is our turn to repay the help we received from your kin. Said Ain Greid, the dwarven chief, gladly greeting Tantu.

His relatively small body grew bigger like any other Giant, and he became wiser and stronger as ever as if he was trying to explode his inner abilities that were being confined in his small body.Tantu reproduced the Ancient Iron Buster with the Dwarves, and then proceeded to make an upgraded Iron Buster that only Giants can use.Tantu was certain that his completed Iron Buster would be able to bring massively destructive power to the Giant kin.",

Considering themselves to be noble guardians of their homeland and proud descendants of the goddess, they dreamt of returning home one day. Thus, there wasn’t a day that went by without training, as they awaited to return to Kamasylvia as the rightful guardians.One day the little girl awoke from her sleep sweaty and exhausted. Nightmares kept haunting her. The image of a gigantic, swaying tree was lodged in her mind. The tree seemed to be screaming in pain while ablaze with fire. The destructive force, enough to scorch life out of the land. When the conflagration had swept over the four corners of the lands, there was a figure who stood before her and looked down. The little girl tried to get a better look at her mysterious tormentor, only for him to vanish out of her mind’s eye.When she finally came to, she told of her visions to her sisters. They could no longer keep ignoring her prophetic dreams. They simply had to prepare for the worst to come, yet another catastrophe. They would first have to send a delegation to the Kama-Grána council. The sisters tried to come up with a way to do this, but even until recently, the Ganelle who had been in conflict with the Ahib gave them the cold shoulder. Over the years Kamasylvia seemed to be recovering its normal state, but the rift between the Vedir and Ganelle didn’t seem to be healing.The little girl insisted someone had to prevent the calamity. But she knew all too well that this far away from the Kamasylve, she wouldn’t be able to use the powers of the spirits of nature to the fullest. She reminded herself of the terrifying presence that felt so real in her nightmare. To defeat it, she just needed more power...There were many who opposed her. She was criticized for risking the very fate of the land. Her opponents called for more conservative techniques to amplify, yet delicately control the energy of nature while sticking with tried and tested methods. Before the catastrophe would even strike, it would seem the various factions were more divided than ever. Yet rumors travel fast and a few Vedir from the land of the Thornbush came to visit the little girl. They were the Ahib who claimed to have obtained much greater power. And this was true. They had changed so much that they were no longer recognizable as their erstwhile sisters. These Ahib had accepted the powers of the black spirits that had once tried to take over their homes. According to the Ahib the energy of the black spirit was a ‘Bottomless Wellspring.’ But something was strange in their demeanor. They didn’t seem to be acting out of their own will, but as if they were being controlled by a greater force.The powers of the Dark Knight, Vedir to be exact, resembled that of the black spirit. As the Vedir overreached and took the energy of the spirits, the black spirit fed off and controlled their minds. Some would go insane as they were completely possessed by the Black Spirits. Those who gave in to the overwhelming powers of darkness shook in pain or would attack anything in sight. Even those who survived the madness seemed to have lost their will and the ability to think on their own. Their eyes would glare with desire and murderous intent.Fortunately not all efforts were in vain. The new, experimental Vediant weapon allowed delicate control of the energy of the black spirits. And this weapon was the most effective against those who were corrupted by the black spirit. The little girl was still struggling against the corrupting influence of the black spirit. If she were to be overwhelmed by the dark power, everything would be lost. She couldn’t lower her guard. The black spirit would try to seduce her, and would strike and utterly consume her if should would falter for just a moment.Time had flown by, maybe the lands has already turned to ashes and ruin. The little girl had finally found the root of the black spirit, in its deepest and darkest reaches. There she would meet a dark reflection of herself, a dark test to prove herself worthy. When the black figure reached out its hand, it vanished like the dust in the wind. The little girl could feel something in her hand. On that day, on the horizon of the wasteland shone a ray of light breaking through the darkness as if a second sun has formed. When she opened her eyes, the little girl could not remember her ordeal in the deepest root of the black spirit. The only thing she could recollect was that a catastrophe was on its way. The little girl whispered to herself:I must protect Kamasylvia.",

Awakened, the Dark Knight skill set has fewer crowd control skills but transitioning back and forth between the two weapons is seamless and easy to master. The awakened damage of the Vediant is notably more powerful than the damage of the Kriegsmesser.",

When they are fighting with the Crescent Pendulum, it almost looks like they are dancing as they cut through their enemies. They are agile and quick on their feet and can quickly deliver devastating attacks by swinging their Crescent Pendulum. By careful manipulation of the swinging motion, they can even deliver attacks from all sides. While enemies are distracted by the bold movements of the Crescent Pendulum, they can swiftly move great distances in the air.",
                                    History ="“Protector of the weak and annihilator of evil.”In a faraway eastern kingdom, there was a towering castle, called Kirin. The growth that covered the back of Kirin Castle began creeping towards the inner walls of the castle.The most prominent noble families of the kingdom were discussing the implications of this omen when a shadow started to creep upon the full moon. Then, a light started glowing from a distant part of the forest nearby.The nobles also noticed a soft and gentle fragrance coming from the forest and surrounding Kirin Castle. One of them, a reputed scholar, said, “This is the scent of an orchid. Isn’t it the most elegant of smells? This smell has been permeating the village nearby for several days already. Wouldn’t you agree it would be the most auspicious omen, and the plant giving off this fragrance would be priceless?” The king, hearing the scholar’s acclamation, commanded his soldiers to search the forest and bring him the source of the fragrance.The king’s soldiers chased after the light in the forest for many leagues. They finally came across a glorious orchid flower. Underneath it was a baby as delicate and magnificent as the flower itself.Soon, a rumor spread that the baby was a goddess of orchids who was reborn into this realm as a blessing from above to the kingdom.The entire kingdom rejoiced. Even the king, who was reviled throughout his kingdom for his cruelty, vowed to raise the baby himself to become a protector of the kingdom.The child had an unimaginable latent potential. Many martial artists of the kingdom, recognizing this, wanted to be the one to teach her. However, the king had his own ideas about what her education should be like.She was taught to perform ceremonial sword dances at festivals and other special events. Even though she performed beautifully, she was not allowed to pursue any further swordsmanship.However, although she was not able to hone her body, she was able to hone her mind under the tutelage of many great sages.At 16, the child became a shrine guardian and she took on many new roles. She did her best to advice the kingdom with her peerless mind and rhetoric. She wanted to put kingdom back on the right track after many years of rule by the reviled king.The common people came to adore her for this. However, there was someone who distrusted her. A man who was tired of being overshadowed by the shrine guardian’s spotlight. This man was an treacherous courtier who schemed his way to his position and to become a confidant of the king.One day, this treacherous courtier met with the king. He whispered into his ears, “For many years, I have been a loyal servant and advisor to this kingdom. Isn’t it preposterous, even treasonous, that some flower child is acting like she has the right to give advice and decide the fate of our kingdom?”This fed into the king’s existing fears. He had taken the orchid child in to try and win his people’s support. However, he had begun to worry that she was a threat to him, and was scheming to take his rightful throne. Knowing that she was immensely popular with his subjects, the king wholeheartedly agreed with the treacherous courtier’s whisperings.He put the shrine guardian under house-arrest and only allowed her out to perform rituals for the shrine.One day, a young man climbed over the walls and snuck into the shrine guardian’s residence. The young man introduced himself Yeung Reung-Hyang. He was already a member of the court, but he claimed that one day, he would be the strongest person in all of the kingdom, as well as the most learned.“I know that you have great potential, shrine guardian, and it’s just waiting to be released. Anyone can tell by how skillful you perform your ceremonial dances. Everyone who sees them is instantly captivated by your skills. Do you really want to spend the rest of your days with only your books to learn from?”The shrine guardian was quick to agree with Yeung. To commemorate this occasion, Melilot gifted the shrine guardian with a long and sturdy cloth to tie up her hair during the many years of rigorous training to follow.And so, they started their training together, unbeknownst to anyone else in the kingdom.The shrine guardian, who was smart and gifted, was soon matched in skill with Melilot. As they trained together, both of their martial arts skill grew more and more.As the years passed, the shrine guardian grew to be a graceful and wise woman and she became even more adore by the people in the kingdom. Meanwhile, words of Yeung’s martial prowess spread throughout the kingdom, and he became a hero figure to the common people.During this time, the king fell more and more paranoid due to the schemes of his treacherous courtier. The king became jealous of the shrine guardian’s popularity. He wanted to banish her from his kingdom, but also didn’t want to give his subjects more reason to hate him.One day, the courtier said to the king, “I am fearful. That woman, that shrine guardian...I am sure she is trying to win over your people so that she can take your rightful throne. You should command her to take Eshi Castle with that troublemaker Yeung Reung-Hyang. Can you believe he’s been trying to rally up the common people to his side? You can use the opportunity to ensure they both will be killed. Only then can Your Grace rest easily once more.”For countless years, the kingdom has been trying to take Eshi Castle. However, it was impregnable.After the king gave the orders for Eshi Castle to be attacked again, Yeung Reung-Hyang and the shrine guardian started marching there straightaway. Although he thought it was strange that very little resources were allocated to this expedition, he did not dare question the king’s orders. Besides, he believed that with the shrine guardian on their side, victory would be certain. After all, although everyone knew of her mental prowess, no one else knew about her martial skills.Six days they marched, and Eshi Castle was still nowhere in sight. They ended up in a vast open field. The reeds swayed in the wind like the waves of a turbulent sea. And suddenly, as if all given an invisible signal, the vanguard turned their spears toward the shrine guardian and Yeung Reung-Hyang. At that moment, Yeung knew...the lack of resources, the aimless wandering with the castle nowhere in sight...it was all a ruse planned so that they could be killed.They both felt conflicted. It is one thing to lose one’s life to an enemy’s blade in the heat of a battle; it’s another thing to be fight your own fellow countrymen, the same people whom you thought were your comrade in arms.The vanguard soldiers did not fear Melilot nor the shrine guardian and charged forward with their spears.As Yeung Reung-Hyang and the shrine guardian stood still, shocked and conflicted, Melilot’s own men fought to protect him against the vanguard soldiers. As they fell one by one, Melilot could not help but cry out in sorrow. He grabbed one of his fallen men’s weapons and started attacking with a vengeance. However, he was greatly outnumbered.When he was about to give up, he saw a Crescent Pendulum swinging and cutting through the attacking soldiers.It was the shrine guardian. She had the Crescent Pendulum on one end and a sword on the other end of the piece of cloth Yeung Reung-Hyang gave her so many years ago. With this strange contraption, she was cutting through her foes in an elegant display of martial arts, the likes of which Yeung had never seen before. She had apparently kept this skill secret even from Yeung Reung-Hyang. He wondered...many countless hours, even years, went into perfecting this deadly art? Watching her fight, Melilot felt a renewed surge of energy. If she hadn’t given up, he wouldn’t either.Finally, the last treacherous soldier fell. The field was now well watered with blood, but despite the carnage around Yeung and the shrine guardian, they somehow smelled a strong fragrance of orchids.Yeung, who was in bad shape and leaning heavily on his sword, said to the shrine guardian, “Get away from here...and go west. If you go back home now...they will find another way to...try...and kill you. So head west...and keep on training. Maybe one day...when you are strong enough...you can come back home...but now...you have to leave.The shrine guardian was confused by Yeung’s rambling and tried to take his hand. However, Yeung slapped her hand away. The shrine guardian suddenly noticed a sword piercing through Yeung’s chest. She understood then what Melilot was trying to say to her. When Yeung saw that the shrine guardian was close to tears, he tried to comfort her.“There is nothing...to be sad about. I will always be with you...in spirit. Every time you train...it will be as if...I am by your side. So please...don’t be upset...Those were Melilot’s last words. As she gathered his dead body into her arms, those words kept going through her head. Yeung was clever and fearless, and this was not how she had envisioned his life to end.After she buried him, she found herself unable to leave his body. She thought back to her life, how she was kept away from people and shut up indoors. She didn’t want to go back to that life. She didn’t want to run away and become a sage either, living her life through books. She had fought and killed. She was a warrior now. She had lost the person closest to her, but her story had just begun.Thus, the shrine guardian promised herself. She will go west, and she will keep training. And one day, she will be strong enough to come back home and face those who betrayed her and Yeung. From now on, she will be the protector of the weak and annihilator of evil.",
